There are two telephone numbers that allow you to listen to NIST time: https://www.nist.gov/time-distribution/radio-station-wwv/telephone-time-day-service

 

 - 303-499-7111 (Colorado)

 - 808-335-4363 (Kauai, Hawaii)

The announcement of the time occurs at the top of each minute and states Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) so it will be necessary to adjust the hour to your local time zone.
