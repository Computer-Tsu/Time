Fix the abbreviation when writing the time, EST (Eastern Standard Time, Central, Mountain, Pacific Standard Time) should not be used during Daylight Savings Time, instead use ET or EDT (or CDT, MDT, PDT).

DST Ends in November.

### At present, daylight saving time in the United States

begins at 2:00 a.m. on the second Sunday of March (at 2 a.m. the local time time skips ahead to 3 a.m. so there is one less hour in the day)

ends at 2:00 a.m. on the first Sunday of November (at 2 a.m. the local time becomes 1 a.m. and that hour is repeated, so there is an extra hour in the day)â€‹

0:00 is midnight (or 12:00 A.M.)
12:00 is noon (or 12:00 P.M.)
Every day has two midnights and midnight is between two days and doesn't belong to either. So the correct description is 'the midnight between Monday and Tuesday', or 'the 25th - 26th midnight' alternatively use 23:59:59 or 0:00:01 instead.
